About me
===
I am a PhD student in the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) natural language processing research group led by [Anders SÃ¸gaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/) at the University of Copenhagen. The goals of my research are to better understand the language models we are using today and to develop language models that exhibit strong generalization while being trustworthy, e.g. differentially private, fair, and interpretable. In particular, I am currently really interested in alternatives to subword tokenization for multilingual language models.

I am funded through a grant by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. As part of the funded project I develop robust recognition models to digitize historical handwritten records that will be used to establish a [multigenerational registry](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/kunstig-intelligens-skal-kortlaegge-danskernes-stam-trae-og-styrke-forskning/) of Danish family relationships.

Previously, I completed my master's in computer science at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Jonas Pfeiffer](https://pfeiffer.ai) and [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp). The results of my thesis are summarized in the paper ["How Good is Your Tokenizer? On the Monolingual Performance of Multilingual Language Models"](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.243/).

Contrary to popular belief, I am not related to [the programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), [the video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(video_game)), or [the home of the Europa-Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust,_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg).

My favorite internet cat is [Big Floppa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Floppa).
