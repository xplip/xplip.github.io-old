About me
===
I'm a computer science student at TU Darmstadt, currently writing my master's thesis under the supervision of PhD student [Jonas Pfeiffer](https://pfeiffer.ai) and [Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ).

My main areas of interest are machine learning & natural language processing, particularly in multilingual, cross-lingual, multi-modal (language & vision), and low-resource settings. 

Contrary to popular belief I am not related by blood to [the programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), [the video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(video_game)), or [the beautiful small town in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust,_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg), home of the country's largest theme park Europa-Park.
