About me
===
I am a PhD Fellow in the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) natural language processing research group at the University of Copenhagen, where I am supervised by [Anders SÃ¸gaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/). My main areas of interest are natural language processing and machine learning, particularly in multilingual, cross-lingual, multi-modal (language & vision), and low-resource settings. I am funded through a grant by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. As part of the funded project, I develop robust recognition models to digitize historical handwritten records, which will be used to establish a [multigenerational registry](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/kunstig-intelligens-skal-kortlaegge-danskernes-stam-trae-og-styrke-forskning/) of Danish family relationships.

Previously, I completed my master's in computer science at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Jonas Pfeiffer](https://pfeiffer.ai) and [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp). The results of my thesis are summarized in the paper ["How Good is Your Tokenizer? On the Monolingual Performance of Multilingual Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15613).

Contrary to popular belief I am not related by blood to [the programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), [the video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(video_game)), or [the beautiful small town in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust,_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg), home of the country's largest theme park Europa-Park.
